# DynaMouse

![](./media/icon-mac.png)

## Intro

Finally, a system for Mac that allows you to have multiple mice, multiple monitors and assign each to one another. 
While Mac allows for multiple mice plugged-in at the same time, it doesn't allow multiple _cursors_ at the same time. 

DynaMouse allows you to assign a specific display to a dedicated mouse device (including the built-in mac trackpads) so that when you have multiple screens in a studio-like/complex workstation setup (and far apart from each other), you don't have to drag your mouse over to the other screen.

Behold:

When you first start DynaMouse and start configuring it, you will be asked to enable a few settings in System Preferences so that Dynamouse can:

* Access HID devices
* Control the mouse position
* Get current displays

## Features

* Works as a system tray, doesn't appear in the dock
* Supports infinit monitors and pointer devices
* Assign multiple mice to the same monitor
* Configure specific mice to be uncontrolled (not governed by DynaMouse)
* Each mouse's position is remembered on each screen
* Non-obtrusive: doesn't lock the mouse to screen bounds, i.e. you can still drag a mouse to a different screen.
* Can be configured to launch on login.
